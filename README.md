# odin-etch-a-sketch

In this project, we are going to create a kind of Etch-a-Sketch, by using divs that change
color when they are hovered over by the mouse cursor. By doing this, we hope to display
aptitude with DOM Manipulation, eventListeners, functions, as well as a bit of style properties. This project will be the most difficult yet, and will require quite a bit of
googling and such. I hope that by completing this project, I'll have greatly improved my
skills with these topics and having built up my confidence.
